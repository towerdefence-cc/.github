## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Just a fun project for a Minecraft minigame server built on Kubernetes :)

Public demo available at towerdefence.cc - Note this is experimental and will be buggy, have many restarts, data is likely to be reset, etc..

We don't provide any documentation or advice on how to set this up for yourself but feel free to take a look at Agones. It's amazing.

Frequently used software:
  - Services - Spring + Java/Go
  - Communication - gRPC
  - Proxy - Velocity
  - GameServers - Minestom
  - Orchestration - Kubernetes + Agones
  - Storage - MongoDB

Some fun info:
  - Tested to hold 1500 players on 16GB RAM and a Ryzen 3600 (single node setup, 20 lobbies and 1 proxy).
  - Currently experimenting and possibly migrating microservices to Go
