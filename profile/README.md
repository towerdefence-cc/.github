## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Just a fun project for a Minecraft minigame server build on Kubernetes :)

There's not much here right now and not a public demo. Feel free to experiment with our code though (will require quite a lot of effort and `publishToMavenLocal`ing)

Frequently software:
  - Spring
  - gRPC
  - Minestom
  - Velocity
  - Kubernetes/Agones
  - MongoDB
