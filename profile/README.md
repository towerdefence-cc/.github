## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Just a fun project for a Minecraft minigame server build on Kubernetes :)

We don't provide any documentation or advice on how to set this up for yourself but feel free to take a look at Agones. It's amazing.

Frequently used software:
  - Services - Spring
  - Communication - gRPC
  - Proxy - Velocity

  - Orchestration - Kubernetes + Agones
